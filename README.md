# BitmexApi

This is a very simple api for Bitmex based on the sample code from  
https://github.com/BitMEX/api-connectors/blob/master/official-http/csharp/BitMEXAPI.cs

It currently contains only the facilities that I am using at the moment, but adding to it is simply a case of adding a call and model for the returned data (and sent data if necessary).
